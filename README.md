# DeBank

My first DApp: A decentralized bank

Functionality: Allows you to deposit ether into a "bank" which will accrue interest on that amount over time in "DeBank Coin". You can withdraw everything at any time.

A project in learning smart contracts, web3.js, truffle, ganache, solidity, and other ethereum blockchain technologies.
